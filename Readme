Ldap_Login is a piwigo plugin to allow people to connect and get access to a piwigo website with their Ldap credentials.

There is an option to allow creation of new users if they are granted access by ldap but don't exist in Piwigo DB.

I have lost interest in this plugin, since my aims (use of ldap credentials) have reached since the first release.
Thus, I stop developping it, or just to maintain compatibility with the current piwigo.

Yet, if one wants to improve, include new functions, I would be really glad to work with him/her, as it's what I miss: new ideas, encouragements, motivation, new skills and testing.

If then, please contact me: stephane @ 22decembre.eu.
