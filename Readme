Ldap_Login is a piwigo plugin to allow people to connect and get access to a piwigo website with their Ldap credentials.

There is an option to allow creation of new users if they are granted access by ldap but don't exist in Piwigo DB.

I have lost interest in this plugin, since my aims (use of ldap credentials) have reached since the first release.
Thus, I stop developping it, or just to maintain compatibility with the current piwigo.

Yet, if one wants to improve, include new functions, I would be really glad to work with him/her, as it's what I miss: new ideas, encouragements, motivation, new skills and testing.

I still receive plenty of mails saying people or businesses use my code and ask me when I update it !
It means you are interested and motivated ! Then help me !

If then, please contact me: stephane @ 22decembre.eu.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND: I WON'T WORK ANYMORE ON THIS WITHOUT ANY HELP, WHICH CAN BE CODE REVIEW, SUGGESTIONS, PROPOSALS... WHATEVER ! REALLY !

I would really like that this plugin is forked, coded again, completely engineered in an other way around !...
